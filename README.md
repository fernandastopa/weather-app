## 🚀 Getting starded

These instructions allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Dependencies

The project requires the installation of the "requests" library to execute API requests. So the only prerequisite is to have Python installed on your system.

To install the "requests" library, you can use the pip package manager, running the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install requests
```

Also, you can simply run the project on Google Colab :)

## ⚙️ Running the application

After running the application in the environment of your choice, enter the location when prompted:

```
Enter the location: Rio de Janeiro
```

Then, enter the temperature unity of your preference:

```
[1] Celsius
[2] Fahrenheit
[3] Kelvin

Enter the temperature unity: 1
```

Then you'll get something like that as a response:

```
The current temperature in Rio de Janeiro is 25 ºC
```
